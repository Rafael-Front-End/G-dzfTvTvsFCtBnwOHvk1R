Thanks for downloading FRANKIE.

Patched together from a couple of other things I was working on, FRANKIE is evocative of other (better) horror fonts. If you want all your text aligned to the same baseline, use all caps. If you want something wackier, try the lower case characters; they're roughly 85% smaller than the upper case letters, and set at arbitrary distances from the baseline. Use it for Halloween flyers, or letters to the mother-in-law. Enjoy!

This font is free to use in all your designs and layouts. FRANKIE may be duplicated and given away as often as you see fit, as long as you INCLUDE THIS README FILE. If you use it for a professional printed job, I'd be floored.

Please take a moment to mention where you found FRANKIE and feel free to comment or criticize, care of "fonts@davebastian.com"
